**INTRODUCTION:** 
For businesses looking to strategically enter the real estate sector, the ever-changing 
face of the industry offers both opportunities and obstacles. In this regard, the wellknown US housing provider Surprise Housing's consideration of entering the Australian 
real estate market stands out. Surprise Housing, with a strong focus on predictive 
analytics and a data-driven methodology, wants to use regularization techniques in 
regression modelling to maximize its potential. The goal is apparent: to provide 
accurate estimates of future property prices, enabling wise investment choices in a 
market renowned for its subtleties and intricacies.
The primary focus of Surprise Housing is to purchase homes at a discount to their 
market prices, then take advantage of market movements to optimize profits. The 
company's primary focus is the Australian real estate market, and it uses both historical 
data and sophisticated statistical techniques to find the best investment prospects. 
Potential financial rewards are important, but so is the larger picture of adjusting to 
changing market conditions and guaranteeing steady growth.
Using a properly chosen dataset to provide a thorough depiction of the Australian real 
estate market is the foundation of this project. This dataset serves as the basis for the 
creation of a regression model that uses regularization strategies. Our goal in analyzing 
this dataset is to find trends, correlations, and patterns that will enable Surprise 
Housing to make well-informed judgments about the purchase of real estate.
Due to the complexity of the Australian real estate industry, a sophisticated and datadriven strategy is required. With this research, we hope to assist Surprise Housing in 
making strategic decisions by providing insights into the elements affecting property 
values in addition to developing a predictive model. It is expected that this project 
would produce benefits beyond short-term financial gain and act as a model for similar 
projects in unexplored real estate markets in the future. As we continue our 
investigation, it becomes clear that Surprise Housing's success in its quest of a 
profitable and sustainable entry into the Australian market is largely due to the 
combination of data science with practical business goals.

**METHODOLOGY:**
1. Importing Data / Reading CSV: 
Importing the required data into the data analysis environment of our choice 
is the first stage in our data analysis and modelling process. Here, the 
relevant data regarding the Australian real estate market is contained in a 
CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file.
2. Data Cleaning:
• Identify Missing Values: Identify and assess the extent of missing 
values in the dataset using methods such as isnull() or info().
• Handle Missing Values: Decide on a strategy for handling missing 
values, whether through imputation, deletion of rows/columns, or 
other methods based on the nature and impact of the missing data.
• Detect and Handle Outliers: Identify outliers that may skew analysis 
and decide on appropriate methods for handling them, such as 
removing outliers or transforming values.
• Check and Correct Datatypes: Verify that each variable has the 
correct data type (e.g., numerical, categorical) and convert as 
needed.
• Remove Duplicate Records: Identify and remove duplicate records to 
avoid redundancy in the dataset.
• Validate Cleaned Dataset: Conduct final checks to ensure that the 
dataset is free from errors, inconsistencies, and missing values.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis:
Exploratory Data Analysis is a crucial phase in understanding the 
characteristics of a dataset, identifying patterns, and generating insights. 
The methodology involves the following steps:
• Summary Statistics: Compute and analyze descriptive statistics, such 
as mean, median, standard deviation, and quartiles, to gain an initial 
understanding of the central tendencies and variability in the dataset.
• Data Visualization: Create visualizations, such as histograms, box 
plots, and scatter plots, to visualize the distribution of individual 
variables and explore relationships between them.
• Correlation Analysis: Examine the correlation between variables 
using correlation matrices or heatmaps to identify potential 
relationships and dependencies.
• Categorical Data Exploration: Explore categorical variables through 
frequency tables, bar charts, or pie charts to understand the 
distribution of categories.
• Outlier Detection: Identify outliers using visualizations or statistical 
methods to assess their impact on data distribution and consider 
appropriate actions.
• Pattern Recognition: Look for patterns or trends in the data that may 
inform subsequent modelling decisions or hypothesis formulation.
4. Data Preparation: 
Data preparation is a critical phase in the data analysis and modelling
process, ensuring that the dataset is well-structured, cleaned, and 
formatted for effective analysis. The methodology involves the following 
steps:
• Handling Missing Data: Identify and address missing values through 
imputation, deletion, or other suitable methods to ensure 
completeness and reliability.
• Dealing with Outliers: Evaluate and handle outliers using appropriate 
methods such as trimming, winsorizing, or transforming values to 
prevent skewed analysis.
• Encoding Categorical Variables: Convert categorical variables into 
numerical format using techniques like one-hot encoding or label 
encoding to make them suitable for modelling.
• Feature Scaling: Standardize or normalize numerical features to a 
common scale, enhancing the performance of certain machine 
learning algorithms.
• Data Splitting: If building predictive models, split the dataset into 
training and testing sets to evaluate model performance on unseen 
data.
• Final Dataset Check: Conduct a final check on the prepared dataset 
to ensure that it is free from errors, inconsistencies, and is 
appropriately formatted for analysis.
5. Building Machine Learning Model: 
When constructing a machine learning model, particularly when dealing 
with regression tasks, Ridge and Lasso regularization techniques can be 
employed to enhance model performance and prevent overfitting. Here is a 
concise methodology for building a machine learning model using Ridge and 
Lasso regularization:
• Model Selection: Choose the appropriate regression model. In this 
case, consider Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression, which are 
extensions of linear regression with regularization.
• Model Training - Ridge Regression: Train the Ridge Regression model 
using the training data. Adjust the regularization strength (Here, 
alpha=0.0001) based on cross-validation or other tuning methods.
• Model Training - Lasso Regression: Train the Lasso Regression model 
similarly, adjusting the regularization strength as needed.
• Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the models on the 
testing set using appropriate evaluation metrics such as Mean 
Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, or others.
• Model Interpretation: Interpret the coefficients of the Ridge and 
Lasso models, which are influenced by regularization. This step 
provides insights into the impact of each feature on the target 
variable.
